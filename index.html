            <p>Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of
                Camellia sinensis, an
                evergreen shrub native to China and East Asia. After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the
                world.</p>

            <p>During a long day of work, sometimes you just need a quick snack or a beverage to break apart the time.
                Though it may
                feel more natural to reach for a soda or a coffee, we have a different recommendation for you: tea.

                Drinking tea has a long list of health benefits like keeping our bodies young and healthy with its
                antioxidants,
                soothing digestion, boosting the immune system, and even improving our smiles.</p>

        <p>All tea comes from only one plant called Camellia sinensis. However, based on the type of tea leaves picked
            and the
            level of oxidation or processing, tea is classified into five main types: Black, Green, Oolong, White, and

                    <p class="description">Fruit teas are made from natural unprocessed fruits. They are naturally sweet
                        but do not have the
                        overpowering sweetness
                        of sugar. Fruit teas are high in antioxidants and vitamin C and do not contain any caffeine,
                        making
                        them ideal for bed.</p>

                        although not to the
                        purists. The correct term
                        for any non-tea beverage is tisane or just herbal infusion. Examples include chamomile,

                        oxidation. This type of processing preserves a high level of antioxidants, vitamins, and
