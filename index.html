            <h2>– Arthur Wing Pinero</h2>
            <p>Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of
                Camellia sinensis, an
                evergreen shrub native to China and East Asia. After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the
                world.</p>

            <p>During a long day of work, sometimes you just need a quick snack or a beverage to break apart the time.
                Though it may
                feel more natural to reach for a soda or a coffee, we have a different recommendation for you: tea.

                Drinking tea has a long list of health benefits like keeping our bodies young and healthy with its
                antioxidants,
                soothing digestion, boosting the immune system, and even improving our smiles.</p>
